## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

data_cleaned <- read_excel("../data_cleaned.xlsx")
# List of aliased variables to remove
aliased_vars <- c("cad_svd", "none_19", "none_31", "alert", "elective")

# Remove the aliased variables from the dataset
numeric_data_cleaned <- numeric_data[, !(names(numeric_data) %in% aliased_vars)]

data_q1 <- data_cleaned[, !(names(data_cleaned) %in% c("cad_svd", "none_19", "none_31", "alert", "elective"))]


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#q1
# Example: Convert "gender" to a dummy variable
#data_q1$gender_M <- ifelse(data_q1$gender == "M", 1, 0)

#data_q1 <- data_q1 %>%
#  mutate(across(c(gender, marital_status, key_complaints_code, mode_of_arrival, 
#                  state_at_the_time_of_arrival, type_of_admsn, 
#                  past_medical_history_code, implant_used_y_n), as.factor))


# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(total_cost_to_hospital ~ body_weight, data = data_q1)

# Display model summary
summary(model)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Check residuals vs fitted values for heteroscedasticity
plot(model, which = 1)

# Check normality of residuals using a Q-Q plot
plot(model, which = 2)

# Check scale-location plot (variance should be constant)
plot(model, which = 3)

# Check influential points (Cook's distance)
plot(model, which = 4)

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Transform total_cost_to_hospital using log
data_q1$log_total_cost <- log(data_q1$total_cost_to_hospital)

# Fit the new model
model_log <- lm(log_total_cost ~ body_weight, data = data_q1)

# Check summary
summary(model_log)

# Recheck residuals
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  # Multiple plots in one window
plot(model_log)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Extract slope (coefficient for body_weight)
beta_weight <- coef(model_log)["body_weight"]
beta_weight

# Compute cost ratio for 1 kg increase
cost_ratio <- exp(beta_weight)

# Compute cost difference for a patient at 50 kg
avg_cost_50kg <- mean(data_q1$total_cost_to_hospital[data_q1$body_weight == 50], na.rm = TRUE)
cost_diff <- avg_cost_50kg * (cost_ratio - 1)

# Print estimated cost difference
cost_diff

# Compute the critical log-difference threshold
threshold <- log(1 + 1000 / avg_cost_50kg)

# Get standard error and t-value for beta_weight
beta_se <- summary(model_log)$coefficients["body_weight", "Std. Error"]
t_value <- (beta_weight - threshold) / beta_se

# Compute p-value for one-tailed test
p_value <- pt(t_value, df = nrow(data_q1) - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Print results
p_value

#Since p-value = 0.1216 > 0.05, we fail to reject H0,Thus, we cannot confidently infer that a 51 kg patient is likely to spend at least INR 1,000 more than a 50 kg patient.
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Given values from the log-linear model
intercept <- 11.690596
slope <- 0.006409
residual_se <- 0.3594

# Compute expected log(cost) for 50 kg
weight_50 <- 50
expected_log_cost_50 <- intercept + slope * weight_50

# Convert to actual cost
expected_cost_50 <- exp(expected_log_cost_50)

# Given package price
package_price <- 300000
log_package_price <- log(package_price)

# Compute Z-score
z_score <- (log_package_price - expected_log_cost_50) / residual_se

# Compute probability
prob_exceed <- 1 - pnorm(z_score)

# Print results
cat("Expected Cost for 50 kg patient:", expected_cost_50, "\n")
cat("Z-score:", z_score, "\n")
cat("Probability of exceeding INR 300,000:", prob_exceed, "\n")

#The probability of exceeding INR 300,000 is only 4.74%, meaning the chance of treatment costs exceeding the package price is relatively low. Therefore, the package price of INR 300,000 may be set too high relative to the expected costs for a 50 kg patient.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
